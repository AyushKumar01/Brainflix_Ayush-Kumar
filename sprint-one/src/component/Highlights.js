              On a gusty day in Southern Utah, a group of 25
              daring mountain bikers blew the doors off what is
              possible on two wheels, unleashing some of the
              biggest moments the sport has ever seen. While
              mother nature only allowed for one full run before
              the conditions made it impossible to ride, that was
              all that was needed for event veteran Kyle Strait,
              who won the event for the second time -- eight years
              after his first Red Cow Rampage title
